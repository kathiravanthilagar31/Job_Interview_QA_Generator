### üöÄ How to Run
Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kathiravanthilagar31/Job_Interview_QA_Generator.git
    cd Job_Interview_QA_Generator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Set up your OpenAI API Key:**
    Your application requires an OpenAI API key to interact with the LLM and embedding models.
    * Create a new file named `.env` in the **root directory** of your project (the same directory as `app.py` and `requirements.txt`).
    * Add your OpenAI API key to this file in the following format:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ```
        (Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.)

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    From the root directory of your project (where `app.py` is located), execute the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This command will start the Streamlit server, and your app will automatically open in your default web browser.
